How to play the game:

The object of the game is to get the player from the grass to the water at the top without being caught in the same square with a bug. If the bug even begins to enter the same square as the player, that crossing attempt is lost and the player is returned to the start position. If the player reaches the water, that attempt is successful, the "Wins" increment, and the player is returned to the start position for another attempt. Movement is controlled by the four keyboard arrow keys. The move happens on key release.

The "Score" is the ratio of successful crossings (Wins) to the sum of both "Wins" and "Losses".

The "p" key lets you select the player avatar from the five displayed by moving the "blue gem" to the desired avatar. The score will reset and the game will start.
The "s" key will reset the score and start the game with either the default player avatar (if none has been selected) or with the previously selected avatar.
